	<h5><a href="https://github.com/dali99/Love">Love</a></h5>
	<p><i>Here be dragons</i></p>
	<p>I made this project as a tribute to my girlfriend, it's quite, quickly done, and was a learning experience (first time I toyed with Node and sockets properly). So please don't look too much into the quality</p>
	<p>Consider yourself warned</p>
	
	<h5>Material Shimmie Theme</h5>
	<h6><a href="https://github.com/dali99/Material-Shimmie-Theme">Material-Shimmie-Theme</a></h6>
	<p>Where I design how I want the different pages to look, without caring for actually implementing it</p>
	<h6><a href="https://github.com/dali99/shimmie2-Material-Theme/tree/Material">shimmie2-Material-Theme</a></h6>
	<p>Shit names, I know, sorry</p>
	<p>This is where I actually implement the theme. I'll often branch out to create a tree for each module though!</p>
